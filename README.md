# Arduino Plugin for [Proffieboard](https://fredrik.hubbe.net/lightsaber/v4/)

## Installing

 1. [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (at least version v1.6.8)
 2. Start the Arduino IDE
 3. Go into Preferences
 4. Add ```https://profezzorn.github.io/arduino-proffieboard/package_proffieboard_index.json``` as an "Additional Board Manager URL"
 5. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install "Proffieboard Plugin"
 6. Select Proffieboard Tools -> Board menu

### OS Specific Setup

#### Linux

 1. Go to ~/.arduino15/packages/profezzorn/hardware/stm32l4/```<VERSION>```/drivers/linux/
 2. sudo cp *.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
 3. reboot

####  Windows

##### STM32 BOOTLOADER driver setup for STM32L4 based boards

 1. Download [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie)
 2. Plugin STM32L4 board and toggle the RESET button while holding down the BOOT button
 3. Let Windows finish searching for drivers
 4. Start ```Zadig```
 5. Select ```Options -> List All Devices```
 6. Select ```STM32 BOOTLOADER``` from the device dropdown
 7. Select ```WinUSB (v6.1.7600.16385)``` as new driver
 8. Click ```Replace Driver```

##### USB Serial driver setup for STM32L4 based boards (Windows 7/XP only, not for Windows 8 or 10)

 1. Go to ~/AppData/Local/Arduino15/packages/profezzorn/hardware/stm32l4/```<VERSION>```/drivers/windows
 2. Right-click on ```dpinst_x86.exe``` (32 bit Windows) or ```dpinst_amd64.exe``` (64 bit Windows) and select ```Run as administrator```
 3. Click on ```Install this driver software anyway``` at the ```Windows Security``` popup as the driver is unsigned

## Troubleshooting

### How do I know if uploads are working?

 Look at the bottom secton of the arduino program. The progress of the upload will show in red text. Unfortunately arduino will not scroll down automatically as uploads are taking place, so if you want to see how it's doing you have to  keep scrolling down while it's working.

### Recovering from a broken upload

 Sometimes a faulty sketch can render the normal USB Serial based integration into the Arduindo IDE not working. In this case plugin the STM32L4 board and toggle the RESET button while holding down the BOOT button and program a known to be working sketch to go ack to a working USB Serial setup.

### Connection issues

#### Windows 10
 Go to the control panel and click on Bluetooth & other devices. It should either show "Proffieboard" or "STM32 BOOTLOADER". If you hold BOOT and click RESET, is hould show "STM32 BOOTLOADER". If neither show up, try a different USB port or cable.

#### Linux
 Running ```sudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log``` will show you when things connect and disconnect, the lsusb command is also helpful.

## Altenative installation method for developers

 1. ```cd <SKETCHBOOK>```, where ```<SKETCHBOOK>``` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * OS X: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
  * Linux: ```~/Arduino```
  * Windows: ```~/Documents/Arduino```
 2. Create a folder named ```hardware```, if it does not exist, and change directories to it
 3. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/profezzorn/arduino-proffieboard.git profezzorn/stm32l4```
 4. Restart the Arduino IDE
 5. Make sure you install any drivers you need from the instructions at the top.

This core is based on the [Arduino STM32L4 Core](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4). For now, the boards from the original core are still supported by this core.
